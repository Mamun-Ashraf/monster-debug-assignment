                <b>Q-1: What is difference between local storage and session storage?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Ans:</b> Data, in localStorage doesn't expire but in session Storage is cleared when the page session
                ends
                (the
                browser or
                tab is closed).
            </p>

                <b>Q-2: What is difference between global scope and local scope?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Ans:</b> Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks.A global variable
                has
                global
                scope and
                is accessible from anywhere in the code.

                Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope and is only
                accessible
                where
                itâ€™s declared.

                <b>Q-3: How event loop of Javascript works?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Ans:</b> The Event Loop works to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
                empty,
                the
                Event Loop
                will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
